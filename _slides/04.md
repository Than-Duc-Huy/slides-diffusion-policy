### Diffusion Policy

From the [paper](https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu/)

> Learns the gradient of the action-distribution score function and iteratively optimizes with respect to this gradient field during inference via a series of stochastic Langevin dynamics steps

Paraphrased

> Learns the **changing gradient** of the action-distribution and iteratively moves the starting noisy actions towards the desired action over the **denoising timesteps** in the reverse diffusion process
