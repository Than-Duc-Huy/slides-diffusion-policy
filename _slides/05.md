### Paper Conclusion

While deep learning continues to require both quantities and quality of data,
<br>
policy architecture can be a bottleneck and diffusion-based policy is a promising solution,
<br>
outperforms behavioral cloning variants, stable and easier to train

### Implications to motion planning

Optimization planner is still important in well-defined factory robot tasks.
<br>
The ability to demonstrate a task will be impactful to household robots 
<br>
where tasks have lower accuracy, higher variability, and less structured.
