### Constrained Optimization Planner

- Gradient-based optimization to minimize a cost, subjected to constraints
  - Kinematic & Dynamic cost: minimize joint velocities, accelerations, and torques
- A trajectory (a sequence of waypoints) is optimized from a starting seed positions
  - Optimization iterations are shown
- After a optimal solution is found, the robot performs the trajectory
