### Architecture

Experiment with different architectures

- Convolutional Net (CNN) with conditioning using [FiLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07871)
- Transformer with cross-attention

- Recommendation: start with CNN for new tasks. If the performance is low due to task complexity, transformer can improve performance but will require tuning
